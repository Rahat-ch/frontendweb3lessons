## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Get your development server running

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Objective

Complete the handleWalletConnect function in `pages/index.js` so the user can connect to your dApp. We will leverage the Ethers library to do so, remember to check out the [Ethers documentation](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/)to learn how to use the package! Once connected display the users address on screen. 

## Challenge

This method only works with in browser injected wallets. Take a look at solutions like [Wallet Connect](https://walletconnect.com/) to make a more robust solution where your dApp can support multiple wallets or even multiple chains!
