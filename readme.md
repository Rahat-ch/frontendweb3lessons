This is a repository of both solved and unsolved code for all lessons 
found on [FrontendWeb3](https://www.frontendweb3.com/).

Unless specified all code lessons are built on top of Next JS.


## How to run examples

Open any of the solved or unsolved folders within the specific activity 
you want to try. 

Most examples can be run with the following scripts:

```bash

yarn 
yarn div
```

or
```bash

npm install
npm run dev
```

Make sure to check the Readme in the activity to verify if there are any other 
instructions for running the examples.
